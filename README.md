# Clustering Cryptos

This is a repository built to cluster cryptocurrencies and create plots to present my results.
Main tasks to accomplish this were:

* Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.
* Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
